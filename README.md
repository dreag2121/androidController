# androidController
currently making a Wacom controllor working with krita on Android 


I am really hoping to finally finsh this year long project, lol. I have a work around that is very brute force. 

This project uses Automate, keymapper and is to use a Wacom express key with Krita on android.

I am going to try to use the JSON formate to setup the database.
